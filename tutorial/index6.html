					<p id="c_top_para">Tensay is the eccentric yet 
					charming Wenja shaman. He chews mind-altering 
					plants, communicates with the spirits of nature, 
					and hold audiences rapt with his colorful stories 
					and animated personality. As the Wenja's only 
					shaman, he is the keeper of the tribe's beliefs. 
					When not lost in a hallucinatory spirit vision, 
					he devotes his attention to healing the wounded, 
					aiding births, and conducting funeral rites for 
					fallen Wenja..</p>

					<p id="c_top_para">A year ago Tensay was captured 
					and enslaved by the fire-wielding Izila tribe. 
					They scorched his flesh with the fiery mark of a 
					slave and forced him to erect their megalithic 
					standing stones. After suffering months of back 
					breaking work, Tensay finally escaped and 
					wrapped himself in a wolf skin to hide in the 
					wilderness. Traumatized and half-crazed, he 
					set out to call upon a spirit strong enough 
					to gather the scattered Wenja tribe and unite 
					them against his former captors</p>
